### SPRINT 1

### SPRINT 2


### SPRINT 3


### RANDOM GOOD TO KNOW:

- caniuse.com <-- Check browser support
- polyfill.io <-- Create a polyfill bundle for most features


- POLYFILL
* Basically a javascript file that puts support for a feature in a browser that does not have it.
(Example: IE 11 may not have Array.prototype.map -> And so you could download a polyfill to put that feature into the browser before your own code runs (ex polyfill.io or from caniuse.com))

- BUNDLE SIZE
* This you can check in the network tab of developer tools in chrome or firefox. Your index.html + all the assets it requires is the bundle size.
